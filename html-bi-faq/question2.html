           <span class="p_text">Access to Blount Island is restricted to only those who have a business purpose and can pass a background check. A TWIC badge includes a background check, and a JaxPort badge proves you have a business purpose. Information about the application process is under Site Requirements > Site Access. You must have supervisor authorization prior to obtaining these badges. Once approved, you will be reimbursed for the badge expense.</span>
